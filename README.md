This is my another project about NLP implementation using Deep learning. Deep LEarning is an advanced concept in ML, which uses creating of multiple layers of learning algorithm. In here, i used a technique called Tf-IDF. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a measure of the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus. It is widely used in information retrieval, text mining, and user modeling1. The TF-IDF score is calculated by multiplying two statistics: term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).
